# PBM Word Detector

This is a Python program that takes as input a file containing a binary image in PBM ASCII format (PGM type P1), which contains text with one or more columns. The program returns the number of lines and words in the text and generates a PBM image with each word enclosed by a rectangle.

## Features

- Opens PBM files and processes binary images.
- Counts the number of lines and words in the text.
- Generates a new PBM image with words enclosed by rectangles.

This project uses the libraries numpy and itertools.
